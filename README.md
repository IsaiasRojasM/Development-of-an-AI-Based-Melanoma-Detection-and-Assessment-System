##  Summary
- Objective: Use CNNs to analyze dermatoscopic images and detect malignant lesions. (To choose if the picture belongs to the cathegory yes or no)
- Approach: Data preprocessing → Model training (Transfer Learning) → Evaluation with metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, AUC, F1 score).
- Results: Achieved XX% accuracy on test data. Improvements using data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
